## ðŸ¤– Intro

>> Our project is a work of three teammates, mentioned at the end of this document.
We've used a new method Called Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model which is a mixe between Quantum Circuits used as Neural Network and a Classical Neural Network,
Our Solution is about Brain Cancer Classification that means Classifying different Tumor types from MRI pictures so a Convolutional Neural Network is a normal method but here we did it with an Hybrid Quantum ConvNet as designed above:

## ðŸ‘‰ Process:
* Retrieve patient MRI image
* Process the image
* predict the result and display it
* Update the database 



## ðŸ‘‰ Installation
* Clone this repository
* Access deployment directory: `cd deployment`
* Run the command: `python manage.py runserver`
* Browse your MRI  and wait for the result
